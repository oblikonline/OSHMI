QUICKSTART:

To quickly run the system after installed, open the OSHMI desktop folder and:

  - On the OSHMI desktop folder: execute _Start_OSHMI.
 OR 
  - Execute the "Webserver" program.
  - Next open the Screen Viewer (and other viewers) using the icons on the OSHMI folder.
 OR
  - Execute the "HMIShell" program (intended method for production/locked HMIs).
  - Next open the Screen Viewer (and other viewers) using the HMIShell.

The default password for HMIShell is "oshmi".

The system is preconfigured to run a simulation with an example point list and screens.
To simulate a command, click on a breaker and push the "Command" button then choose 
  an action like "open" or "close" and push the action button.
To stop the system click on the "Stop_All" icon in the OSHMI folder.
To edit and create new SVG screens, use the customized Inkscape+SAGE 
  (shortcut in the OSHMI folder). 
Screens are in "c:\oshmi\svg\".
OSHMI configuration files are in "c:\oshmi\conf\".
For more info about configuration please read the OSHMI Configuration Manual.

By default, the system is configured to allow HTTP access only by the local machine.
To allow other IP addresses edit the "c:\oshmi\conf\nginx_access_control.conf" file.
To configure safe remote client access, configure IP address access control, HTTPS, 
  client certificates and user authentication directly in the Nginx configuration files.

Notes for version 6.0:

This release introduces many performance optimizations under the hood.
Some scripted displays may break due to changes in the the way the SVG file is now attached to the page.
The example displays were updated, if you are updating OSHMI over a previous version
please copy them (*.svg) from the config_templates folder to SVG folder.

Data Client Mode:
 - Now OSHMI can be configured as a data client to access an OSHMI server, the client requests only realtime data. 
   In this mode the local installation must have all SVG files.
   This mode makes possible extremely low bandwidth communications with the remote server.
   This is ideal for satellite, GPRS and other applications that require very low bandwidth comms.
   Data can be encrypted (using https/client certificates) and compressed by the Nginx remote server.
   The old Client Mode that requests everything to the server is still available.

Webserver:
 - Replaced Indy HTTP server with a new server based on the GNU Libmicrohttpd (DLL).
 - Possibility of starting microhttpd daemon in single thread mode or thread per connection.
 - Added http header "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" for CORS. Default origin is "*".
 - Significant performance optimizations of real time data queries.
 - Fixed JSON command sent to invalid secondary address (redundant mode only).
 - Fixed problem when received malformed float value.

Screen Viewer:
 - Modified insertion of the SVG file in the page (from inside an <object> to direct <svg>).
 - Changed point values queries to HTTP GET method instead of POST.
 - SVG file loaded with fetch().
 - Faster loading of displays with less DOM style recalculations (reflows).
 - Fixed redundant processing of SAGE/XSAC tags for SVG TEXT elements.
 - Make Animate, RemoveAnimate, ShowHideTranslate and ShowImage functions available through WebSAGE/$W object.
 - Vega updated to version 4.4.0.
 - Vega-Lite updated to version 2.6.0. 
 - No more support for older browsers like I.E. as Vega 4 requires ES6.
 - Better error management in vega_websage.js.
 - Elements linked to invalid or unavailable tags are now made invisible and it is logged to the 
   console the tag and element id.
 - D3JS number formatting support for "Get" directive.
 - Color templates shortcuts (-clr-nnn) available also for Vega visualization specifications.
